hackvr... um. outputs commands to stdout based on keys pressed inside hackvr,
and inputs the same type of commands.
so do some plumbing and get a multiplayer game going?

quick start:

You'll need to have the library and headers of libx11 installed for hackvr to build successfully.
Which usually means you will need the dev version of the libx11 (xlib) package for your distro.
To get that on debian you might run

  apt-get install libx11-dev

After you have that installed you should be able to do these to get hackvr built:

  cd src
  make

A few helper scripts are written in perl and python.
So you might want to install perl and python if you want to play with them.
They're pretty nifty.

what hackvr can do...

I dunno.

Red and Blue mode

You'll have to either enable this using a command sent to hackvr's stdin that
I don't even remember, or just enable it in config.h make clean then rebuild.
Be sure to have SPLIT_SCREEN set to 2 while you have RED_AND_BLUE set to 1.
Otherwise you'll just end up with one camera that is red. Three cameras will
draw a third view that is also red. (colors of views are picked by modulo two of
camera number atm)

left eye should have red over it.
right eye should have blue over it.

if your glasses are backwards you can either wear them upside down.
or just flip the value of CAMERA_SEPARATION in config.h before building.
or fiddle with it using the 'p' and 'l' keys while hackvr is running.
