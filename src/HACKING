oh god. I have no idea what I'm doing.

may the gods have mercy on my soul for this monstrosity..

so.

hackvr.c can optionally use graphics or not.

if you choose to have graphics you can choose between:

x11 or opengl+glut

There are three layers of the graphics code..

I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to combine these.

graphics_c3.c uses functions defined in a graphics_c2* file.
graphics_c2.c uses function defined in a graphics_cs* file.

some graphical backends may provide their own graphics_c3.c?
